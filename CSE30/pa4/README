Description
-----------
    a two part interactive program meant to check if 
  an email is in a list of spam addresses or not. 
    The first part will read in email data files and 
  populate hash tables with these email addresses, 
  then write out these populated tables into an output
  file. 
    The second part will allow for user interaction
  with the data. It will first read in the tables that
  were written to the output file from the first part and
  will then allow the user to enter email addresses and 
  check if they are spam. 
    If the email address is found in all of the tables 
  then there is a high chance that the email is a spam email. 
  In our program, if the email address is found in all of 
  the tables, then it is definitely a spam. 

How to compile
--------------
  To compile this program, simply navigate to the directory containing the
  source files for PA4 (which should include the Makefile) and type 'make'.

How to run
----------
  To run the program, type the executable name
  For example:

	 ./create -i dataFile -o outFile [-s size] [-h]
	 ./search -i inFile [-x] [-h]

Normal output
-------------
cs30xgz@pi-cluster-005:~/pa4$ ./create -i emails/emails_10 -o testw
cs30xgz@pi-cluster-005:~/pa4$ ./search -i testw -x
	Enter a word: ti452@spam.me
	ti452@spam.me is SPAM!
	Enter a word: l
	l is not SPAM!
	Enter a word: 


Abnormal output
---------------
  Abnormal output is printed to stderr.
  For example:
  	cs30xgz@pi-cluster-005:~/pa4$ ./search            
	Search requires an infile argument.

	Usage: ./search -i inFile [-x] [-h]

	Missing file args

	Usage: ./create -i dataFile -o outFile [-s size] [-h]

	
Testing
-------
  For pushToList, revHash, evenOddHash, populateTables and 
  writeTables function, I make unit testing file to test them.
  For pushToList, I tried to create a linkedlist and see if it 
  pushes the struct correctly. For revHash I tried various random
  value to see if it matches the result of result that I calculate
  myself. For evenOddHash.s I also tried various random value to 
  see if it matches the result that I calculate. For populateTables,
  I create the corresponding struct and table and see if it is populated 
  correctly. For writeTables, I try to write different size of files in
  email file and use xxd to see if the hex version of the output is 
  resonable. For the remaining function, for some of them I worte 
  unit testing to test them, and also I use the correct functions above
  and try all kinds of input to see if the result matches the sample 
  executable. Or if the error message is matching the sample executable
  when we type in wrong flag or missing flag, etc.

  

ANSWER:
	1. You have to write the code yourself or ask tutor for help
	in order to really learn something. I feel so sorry about refusing
	you, but no I could not give you my code.

	2. TAB
	
	3. colorscheme desert
